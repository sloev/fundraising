my experiences in fundraising

## 1. Thank you Charlie for being a light in 2020

### Motivation
I personally had benefited a lot from the "tribe" of people on nts chat and that together with the "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show" proved to be a light tower in an otherwise year of loneliness, listening in every day gave me a feeling of being in a community once again and pushed me out to meet people.

I wanted to figure out if other people shared my sentiment and see if i could find a way to express this in the form of currency transmitted to Charlie.


### Creation of campaign

While listening to [nts.live](https://nts.live) and being on [their chat system](https://www.nts.live/chat) i announced that i thought we should make a fundraiser for the radio host Charlie Bones to show gratitude for his radio show ["The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show"](https://www.nts.live/shows/the-do-you-breakfast-show).

I went for [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com) as i was part of [another fundraiser in 2020 for the music venue Loppen](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-loppen) which went rather smooth but this time the problem was i didnt know the person i was collecting for.

I anticipated that i needed to keep a full transparency log in order to gain peoples trust and to keep a public record of my actions and communications.

I created a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm4J1krGMiE7V1OrtNwdJ6tZw6qfi0pxsvyjzcLKx0g) and began writing log entries in it, those log entries are the foundation for this "blog post".

I created a gofundme campain [gofundme.com/f/thank-you-charlie-for-being-a-light-in-2020](https://www.gofundme.com/f/thank-you-charlie-for-being-a-light-in-2020) and published it with a small text plus posted it in the nts chat (i will come back to this later in this document)

Afterwards i contacted a few email adresses i found on nts.live as well as their twitter page. After a few moments i got told by the nts twitter to contact a person at nts. I already had the email adress of the "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show" so i wrote an email to the show and cc'd the email i got from the twitter account.

Here is the first email i send:

```
Hi Charlie, sorry to interrupt you (CC'ing flo@REDACTED_HERE according to advice from nts twitter)

We are a bunch of fans hanging out in the chat and being thankful for your company on airwave during last years pandemic.

We wanna make a gofundme to show our gratitude so i created one:
gf.me/u/zm636h
i have invited you to it from gofundme.

i know it might be a bit overwhelming but we mean it sincerely.
i am keeping a full transparency on the creation and progress of the fundraiser here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm4J1krGMiE7V1OrtNwdJ6tZw6qfi0pxsvyjzcLKx0g/edit?usp=sharing

if you for any reason (that you dont need to disclose) find that you dont want this gofundme happening please write me and i will terminate it and pay back all fundings to fundraisers, plus write in the channel that i have done so in agreement with you.

I hope i am not interfering with your day in a negative way.

kind regards johannes valbj√∏rn (supernihil on chat)
```

A few moments later i got a reply from Charlie where he confirmed that he was ok with me making the crowdfund campaign, I wrote it in the google doc log.
