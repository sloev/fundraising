my experiences in fundraising

## 1. Thank you Charlie for being a light in 2020

### Motivation
I personally had benefited a lot from the "tribe" of people on nts chat and that together with the "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show" proved to be a light tower in an otherwise year of loneliness, listening in every day gave me a feeling of being in a community once again and pushed me out to meet people.

I wanted to figure out if other people shared my sentiment and see if i could find a way to express this in the form of currency transmitted to Charlie.


### Creation of campaign (17 March 2021)

While listening to [nts.live](https://nts.live) and being on [their chat system](https://www.nts.live/chat) i announced that i thought we should make a fundraiser for the radio host Charlie Bones to show gratitude for his radio show ["The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show"](https://www.nts.live/shows/the-do-you-breakfast-show).

I went for [gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com) as i was part of [another fundraiser in 2020 for the music venue Loppen](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-loppen) which went rather smooth but this time the problem was i didnt know the person i was collecting for.

I anticipated that i needed to keep a full transparency log in order to gain peoples trust and to keep a public record of my actions and communications.

I created a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm4J1krGMiE7V1OrtNwdJ6tZw6qfi0pxsvyjzcLKx0g) and began writing log entries in it, those log entries are the foundation for this "blog post".

I created a gofundme campain [gofundme.com/f/thank-you-charlie-for-being-a-light-in-2020](https://www.gofundme.com/f/thank-you-charlie-for-being-a-light-in-2020) and published it with a small text plus posted it in the nts chat (i will come back to this later in this document)

Afterwards i contacted a few email adresses i found on nts.live as well as their twitter page. After a few moments i got told by the nts twitter to contact a person at nts. I already had the email adress of the "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show" so i wrote an email to the show and cc'd the email i got from the twitter account.

Here is the first email i send:

>Hi Charlie, sorry to interrupt you (CC'ing flo@REDACTED according to advice from nts twitter)
>
>We are a bunch of fans hanging out in the chat and being thankful for your company on airwave during last years pandemic.
>
>We wanna make a gofundme to show our gratitude so i created one:
>gf.me/u/zm636h
>i have invited you to it from gofundme.
>
>i know it might be a bit overwhelming but we mean it sincerely.
>i am keeping a full transparency on the creation and progress of the fundraiser here:
>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm4J1krGMiE7V1OrtNwdJ6tZw6qfi0pxsvyjzcLKx0g/edit?usp=sharing
>
>if you for any reason (that you dont need to disclose) find that you dont want this gofundme happening please write me and i will terminate it and pay back all fundings to fundraisers, plus write in the channel that i have done so in agreement with you.
>
>I hope i am not interfering with your day in a negative way.
>
>kind regards johannes valbjÃ¸rn (supernihil on chat)


A few moments later i got a reply from Charlie where he confirmed that he was ok with me making the crowdfund campaign, I wrote it in the google doc log.

### Figuring out payment

I wrote Charlie an email where i presented a few options for how to solve the payment issue:

>1. i could organize with nts so i transfer to them and they relay it to you (in this way you dont need to share personal info with me)
>2. we could arrange something through paypal (in this way you only leak the info you normally leak when engaging in ebay stuff)
>3. you can give me your bank information and i make a direct deposit (this is by far the most insecure option, which even though the easiest, has a risk of data leakage)

After a while he responded with the option he liked the best and i started to setup Stripe (gofundme uses Stripe for processing payments) to figure out a way to easily relay the fundings to Charlie.

### Social media

I went to LinkedIn and wrote [a post about the fundraiser](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6777980048096935937-rsdl) since my idea was that a lot of people were posiitively influenced by his show and some might wanna be offered the option of "paying back", some of these people might however not hang around in the nts chat like me.

I used the LinkedIn post as my main copy for the fundraiser and copied it into the gofundme page, it read:

>In 2020 his program "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show" on independent internet radio nts.live became a goto for pandemic cabin fever not only for me but for thousands of others
>(see the article on the theface.com about his show an the pandemic: https://theface.com/music/charlie-bones-do-you-breakfast-show-nts-london)
>
>The chat system on nts.live radio was glowing up with as much as 20 messages per second every day Charlie went on at 10:00 (DK time), from the messages you saw people looking for companionship in a time where loneliness were peaking in a way not seen for years.
>
>Charlie's honesty about his own struggles in these times further increased peoples ability to relate and not feel alone with their issues.
>
>And his music selection is beyond compare, which often prompts the chat to explode in "big vibes" messages :-)
>
>Its now 2021 and i thought it would be a great idea to give back to Charlie for making 2020 less ruff with his light tower of funk on nts.live
>
>Please help me provide some gratitude in form of currency to this guy:

I made an update post on the gofundme page with a link to the google transparency doc.

I finally got the address for the facebook group of the "The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show", i went there and saw that there already were some posts regarding the fundraiser plus some questions about it.

I addressed the questions and made sure to copy the answers to the google transparency doc as well as the gofundme page as updates.

The main question i answered was how i could prove i wasnt pocketing the money myself, i answered this:

>basically my stragedy has been:
>1. share as much personal information (as i am comfortable with) in order to validate my identity as much as possible
>2. contact as many people at nts as i found relevant in order to tell of the fundraiser plus leave my contact details if they need to contact me etc.
>3. be transparent (in the open google doc) about my actions and communications (without spilling personal info) so you can follow a long
>
>if you have more questions please ask!
>my email is in the document, you can contact me there if you have questions you wanna ask in private as well.


### Reached goal (18 march 2021 18:38)

The fundraise reached 100% ðŸŽ‰

I wrote on the facebook page, LinkedIn, nts chat and on the gofundme page.

I then wrote to tell Charlie about it and tell him the expected date where Stripe would be able to transfer the funds.

### Lessons learned

1. I would have liked if i had confirmed with Charlie before i published the gofundme campaign.
